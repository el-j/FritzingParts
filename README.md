# FritzingPartsApi

Small mockup of a Api to request the different Fritzing Parts files.


## Idea

Generate a static HTTP Api of the data of the Fritzing Parts.
To bring up online the Api we use the GitHub Pages.


## Development

This is an experiment!

The following files/folders will be generated by the `make build` task

    parts/
    parts.json
