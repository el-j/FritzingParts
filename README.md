# FritzingPartsApi

Small mockup of an Api to request the different Fritzing Parts files.


## Idea

Generate a static HTTP Api of the data of the Fritzing Parts.
To bring up online the Api we use the Jekyll Server running on GitHub Pages.


## Development

**This is in experimental state!**

The following files/folders will be generated by the `make build` task

    parts/
    parts.json
    parts.html

The Makefile is splitted into different tasks. This tasks generates different files we need to generate the website.

To run the jekyll server on your local machine,  execute the following command:

    make server
