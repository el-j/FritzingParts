    "The LilyPad Battery Connect simply gives you a connection point for a battery or anything else you might want to plug in to your LilyPad system. It consists of a single 2-pin JST connector on a small LilyPad board with positive and negative terminals.\n\nLilyPad is a wearable e-textile technology developed by Leah Buechley and cooperatively designed by Leah and SparkFun. Each LilyPad was creatively designed to have large connecting pads to allow them to be sewn into clothing. Various input, output, power, and sensor boards are available. They're even washable!\n\nNote: The LilyPad Coin Cell Battery Holder is a design conceived by Felicia Williams of Boulder, Colorado. Also, a portion of this sale is given back to Dr. Leah Buechley for continued development and education of e-textiles."
